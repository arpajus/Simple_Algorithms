In this repository I'am going to add simple algorithms that I think can resolve some problems with clever solutions

The CountingOcurrences:
Code expects an input of a large number. Could be for example 726322
Then, expects an input of the number you want to know how many times is on the large number. 
This problem can be solved on different ways like switching the number to a String and look all the parts of the String. This is just an idea to make a simple code. 

ReverseNumber:
Code expects an input of a number and the output will be the reverse of the number given. If you recieve 456 the program will output 654. The problem is solved by a mathematical way. Just divide the number on 10 every time. Take the reminder and the reverse will be the old reminder *10 plus the actual reminder.
