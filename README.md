In this repository I'am going to add simple algorithms that I think can resolve some problems with clever solutions

The CountingOcurrences:
Code expects an input of a large number. Could be for example 726322
Then, expects an input of the number you want to know how many times is on the large number. 
This problem can be solved on different ways like switching the number to a String and look all the parts of the String. This is just an idea to make a simple code. 

ReverseNumber:
Code expects an input of a number and the output will be the reverse of the number given. If you recieve 456 the program will output 654. The problem is solved by a mathematical way. Just divide the number on 10 every time. Take the reminder and the reverse will be the old reminder *10 plus the actual reminder. 

Calculator:
Basic calculator with just four operations just to show how to work with while doing iterations until the user wants to finish.

ReverseArray:
A basic algorithm using two methods where you reverse an array. Just swapping the first position with the last position, the second position with last-1 of the array and so on. The main thing here is that we have two int with a behaviour of two pointers pointing at the start and at the end. And this two pointers are moving while we are swapping the positions. 

Richest Customer Wealth:
The solution for this problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/
The objective is to return the max money of the accounts. The input would be an array of double dimension like [1,2,3][4,5,6].
Every row of the array is how accounts has one person and the number is the amount of money there are on the account. 

BinarySearch:
The traditional algorithm to search an element on a sorted array using the Binary Search algorithm. This method improves the Time complexity having a O(log n) being n the numbers of elements on a array. The algorithm is usefull if the array is ascending sorted or descending sorted.
